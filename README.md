Facebook Page Plugin
====================

Facebook Page Plugin provides a configurable block that displays an embedded
timeline for the specified Facebook Page. It's an integration of Facebook's
[Page Plugin](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/page-plugin/) API.

This Backdrop module is a port of the
[FB Likebox](https://www.drupal.org/project/fb_likebox) Drupal module. It has
been renamed to better reflect its current integration method and, as yet, no
upgrade path exists (i.e. your Drupal 7 block(s) will need to be re-configured
in Backdrop).

Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.

- Edit a layout under Administration > Structure > Layouts > [LAYOUT]
  (admin/structure/layouts/manage/[LAYOUT]) and add the `Facebook page plugin`
  block to a region. Configure the block settings, entering at least a Facebook
  Page URL.
